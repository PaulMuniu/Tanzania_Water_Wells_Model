    "## 1. BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING.\n",
    "### Overview.\n",
    "Tanzania, a developing country with a population of 68.42 million as of January 2024, faces significant challenges in providing clean water to its people. According to a recent United Nations World Water Development Report, around 2 billion people globally lack access to clean and safe drinking water. In Tanzania, the crisis is even more acute: out of its 65 million people, 58 million (88% of the population) lack access to safe water. This severe shortage of clean water exacerbates health issues, economic hardships, and educational disparities across the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement.\n",
    "The aim of this project is to predict the operational status of water wells in Tanzania using data on various features such as the type of pump, the year it was installed, and the management practices. Accurately predicting which water points are functional, which need repairs and which are non-functional will enable more effective maintenance operations and improve access to clean water for Tanzanian communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives.\n",
    "1. Data Analysis and Preprocessing: Thoroughly analyze and clean the dataset to ensure it is suitable for modeling.\n",
    "2. Model Development: Train and evaluate multiple classification models to identify the most accurate and precise model for predicting the status of water wells.\n",
    "3. Model Evaluation: Use accuracy and precision as the primary metrics to evaluate the model's performance. These metrics will help determine how well the model identifies the status of water wells given various factors.\n",
    "4. Deployment: Deploy the final model to our stakeholders, to aid in making data-driven decisions for maintaining and improving water access in Tanzania.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholder: **WaterAid**\n",
    "*Organization Overview.*\n",
    "\n",
    "WaterAid is an international non-governmental organization (NGO) based in the United Kingdom. The organization is dedicated exclusively to ensuring equitable access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene education for the world‚Äôs poorest communities. WaterAid has a profound impact on improving health, education, and economic opportunities by providing sustainable solutions for water and sanitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Project Mandate.*\n",
    "\n",
    "WaterAid has tasked us with developing a predictive model to determine the operational status of water wells in Tanzania. This life-changing project aims to optimize the allocation of resources for maintenance and repair, ensuring that more people have access to clean and safe drinking water. By leveraging data-driven insights, WaterAid can enhance its mission of providing essential water services to underserved communities and contribute to global efforts in alleviating water and sanitation crises."
